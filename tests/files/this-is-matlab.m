% Example of a controller based on quadratic programming with Euclidean error calculation.
%
% CONSTRAINED_CONTROLLER_EXAMPLE(plane_constraint) Runs a simple example where a
% controller based on classic quadratic programming and the objective function
% min 0.5 * norm(J*u + gain*task_error)^2 + 0.5*lambda*norm(u)^2 is
% used with an Euclidean error to control the end-effector pose while it is
% constrained by a plane.
% If plane_constraint = 0, the trajectory is NOT constrained by the plane in the
% workspace, otherwise the trajectory is contrained by the plane.
